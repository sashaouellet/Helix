# Helix
This comprehensive system is an ongoing project that I am designing and building as a part of a collaborative class between Visual Effects, Animation, and Film classes. Together, these classes will produce 2 short films so I have been tasked with the laying out the pipeline architecture for both films.
 
This tool is being designed with other projects in mind, so that it can scale appropriately from large group films to smaller senior studio films.
